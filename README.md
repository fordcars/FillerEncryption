FillerEncryption
================

An javascript encryption algorithm that uses pseudo-random numbers for improved security. It is simple as using encrypt(value, keycode) and decrypt(value, keycode).

Currently, it is fairly hard-coded, this is because I wrote it quickly and dirty, but it turned out pretty cool, so I will still be working on it.

NOTE: This uses Math.random() for random numbers, instead of the cryto API. Should we use it instead?
